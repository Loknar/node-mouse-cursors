node-mouse-cursors example
============

A modified example from the book "Smashing Node" using Socket.io instead of websocket.

For every visitor on the web page there appears a cursor mimicing the movement of the visitor's cursor.

You can check this example out at [herokuapp](http://node-mouse-cursors.herokuapp.com/) but it looks smoother if you download it and run it locally on your computer. For it to run locally you must install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), then navigate to the folder via your terminal and execute the following:

```
npm install
node mouse-server.js
```

and you should have the example up and running on [localhost:3700](htts://localhost:3700/)
